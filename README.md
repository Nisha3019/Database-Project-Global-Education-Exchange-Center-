  - **Install MySQL** – Download and install MySQL and complete the setup.

  - **Open MySQL Workbench or Command Line** – Launch MySQL Workbench or use the command line to access MySQL.

  - **Create a Database** – Set up a new database for the project.

  - **Execute SQL Script** – Run the provided SQL script to create tables, relationships, and constraints.

  - **Verify Database Setup** – Check if the tables and data are correctly inserted.

  - **Test Queries and Triggers** – Run sample queries to ensure the database functions as expected.

**Insights:**

  - **Data Organization & Efficiency** – The database effectively stores and manages structured data, improving retrieval speed and organization.
  - **Relationships & Integrity** – Proper implementation of foreign keys ensures data consistency and avoids redundancy.
  - **Query Performance** – Optimized queries allow efficient data retrieval, enhancing overall database performance.
  - **Data Trends & Analysis** – Aggregated queries reveal patterns such as frequent transactions, popular products, or peak usage times.
  - **Security & Constraints** – Implemented constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) help maintain data accuracy and prevent anomalies.
  - **Automation via Triggers** – Triggers automate tasks like logging changes or updating related tables, reducing manual effort.
